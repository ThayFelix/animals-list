### Delete Button

- Add a "Delete" button to the right of the "Make Noise" button
- The delete button should only show when you hover on an animal
- The delete button should remove the animal from the list

### Add Button

- Add an "Add" button below the last animal
- The add button should create a random animal
 
### React.Context

- Move the animals into a React.Context, instead of passing as as prop to AnimalsView
